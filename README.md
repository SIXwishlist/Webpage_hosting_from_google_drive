Easy way of hosting webpages using a Google Drive Account

Recently I found a easy and cheap way to host a webpage using a Google Drive account. Google App Script(GAS) is used which creates the webpage according to an uploaded HTML file.

In the code Code.gs contains the GAS code, Form.html the webpage , Design.html the CSS code and Check.html the JS code.

## Steps:
1. Sign into your Google Account and google "app script editor".
2. Open the relevant Google link and click start scripting.
3. Code.gs file is already created.
4. Create the other files from File menu.
5. After completing the webpage, click on Publish menu.
6. Select Deploy as Web-App
7. Name the project.
8. The url of the webpage will be displayed.
9. Assign version number, make the webpage public or private.
10. Click Update.

## Your webpage is now hosted from your drive!
